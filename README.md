# LC085 - Darren Maverick - React JS Qualification

My web app is called --"moviedex"-- and it's a simple movie search application that allows users to search and save their favorite movies. The frontend of this app is built using React.js.

When a user opens the app, they are presented with a clean and minimalistic interface where they can search or to favorite the movies. Each movie card have their details such as title name, release date, and a favorite button. The favorite button is also present in the movie details

## The app stores the task data on the local storage to save their favorited movies.
The provider used is axios, using REST API from tmdb (The Movie Database) for the movie data
