# LC085 - Darren Maverick - React JS Qualification

### My web app is called "moviedex" and it's a simple movie search application that allows users to search and save their favorite movies. The frontend of this app is built using React.js.

### When a user opens the app, they are presented with a clean and minimalistic interface where they can search or to favorite the movies. Each movie card have their details such as title name, release date, and a favorite button. The favorite button is also present in the movie details
